[HEADER]
# this section gives some reference parameters for the signal generator
# - sampling frequency [Hz]
fcamp = 125E6;
# - gain (must be [0:6]) []
gain = 1;
# - how many times the signal should be repeated (0 means unlimited):
repeat = 100;
#
#
[SIGNAL]
# actual signal (-1:1) []
# NOTA BENE:
# 1. in order to have a proper FFT, the signal at its extremes in time (i.e. at the beginning and end) must be continuous and with the first two derivatives to 0.0;
# 2. values must be separated by ";"
# 3. the max resolution is 16 bits, i.e. 1/65536~=1.53E-5; hence, I would not go beyond a precision of FP representation larger than "% 13.6E"
